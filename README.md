### Perceiver-Actor

This will be the official code repository for the [PerAct](https://peract.github.io/) paper. 

We are still in the process of cleaning up, but this [**Colab Tutorial**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wpaosDS94S0rmtGmdnP0J1TjS7mEM14V?usp=sharing) contains everything you need for training PerAct from scratch. The only things missing from this tutorial are our modifications to [RLBench](https://github.com/stepjam/RLBench) and [YARR](https://github.com/stepjam/YARR) for multi-task data-generation, training, and evaluation.
